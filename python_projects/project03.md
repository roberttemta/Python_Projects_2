## At work, there is a need for a python script that can convert .xml files to JSON format. To execute this script, we took "test.xml" file as an example. We can get that file from the current directory.

### The script is below:

```python
# install json and xmltodict modules if you don't have it yet
# import json module and xmltodict module provided by python

import json
import xmltodict

# open the input xml file and read
# data in form of python dictionary
# using xmltodict module
with open("test.xml") as xml_file:
	
	data_dict = xmltodict.parse(xml_file.read())
	xml_file.close()
	
	# generate the object using json.dumps()
	# corresponding to json data
	
	json_data = json.dumps(data_dict, indent=4)
	
	# Write the json data to output json file called output
	with open("xml_converted.json", "w") as json_file:
		json_file.write(json_data)
		json_file.close()
xml_file.close()
```
