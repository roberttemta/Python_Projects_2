## Automating AWS infrastructures with Python & Boto3

### In this directory, we are going to show you how to use the Boto3 module to achieve AWS tasks.
#### For this purpose, we work with 4 primary AWS services: EC2, S3 and IAM, SQS.

* **ec2_boto3_code.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
* **s3_boto3_code.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
* **Iam_boto3_code.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* **sqs_boto3_code.py**: this script contains the experiments made with Boto3 and Amazon Simple Queue Services (SQS).

## Install Boto3 module on Python

**Prerequisites: Install and configure awscli**
